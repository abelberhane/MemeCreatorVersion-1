# Meme Creator Version-1

Meme Creator made with C#. This will be my first attempt at opening folders in an app and saving an image. I also will be working with 
Previewing an Image for the first time before being able to save it. There are new elements and some familiar elements to this project. The OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog were simple once I understood their syntax and I was able to get everything opened/Saved no problem. The try catch phrases was the piece of logic that I needed to review the most. 

Personally, it does bug me that the Preview text shows the background for the labels as they are written but I am happy that it saves without it. That would be something I would want to look into and see if I can fix.
